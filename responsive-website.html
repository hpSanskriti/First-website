                <p class="subTag text-small">Founded around the 9th century and 10th century by 
                    Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw, Helga Hufflepuff and Salazar Slytherin, 
                    Hogwarts was established in the Highlands of Scotland to educate young wizards 
                    and witches as well as to keep students safe from Muggle persecution. 
                    Theory has it that Rowena Ravenclaw came up with the name of Hogwarts after 
                    dreaming of a warty hog that led her to a cliff by a lake. 
                    Since then, Hogwarts educated most wizarding children with residence in Great Britain 
                    and Ireland, keeping its location hidden from other wizarding schools and Muggles.

                <p class="subTag text-small">Hogwarts is divided into four houses, each bearing the last name 
                    of its founder: Godric Gryffindor, Salazar Slytherin, Rowena Ravenclaw and Helga Hufflepuff. 
                    Throughout the school year, the houses compete for the House Cup, gaining and losing points 
                    based on actions such as performance in class and rule violations. The house with the highest 
                    end-of-year total wins and has its colours displayed in the Great Hall for the following school
                    year. Each house also has its own Quidditch team that competes for the Quidditch Cup. Being a 
                    school of magic, many subjects at Hogwarts differ from the studies of a muggle school. Some 
                    subjects, such as History of magic, derive from non-wizard or muggle subjects, but many others, 
                    such as charms and apparition classes, are unique to the wizarding world. There are twelve named 
                    teachers (referred to as Professors), each specialising in a single subject. All professors are 
                    overseen by a school head and deputy head.

                    Astronomy, History of magic, and Herbology are compulsory subjects for the first five years, as well as 
                    flying lessons. At the end of their second year, students are required to add at least two optional subjects 
                    to their syllabus for the start of the third year. The five choices are Arithmancy, Muggle Studies, 
                    Divination, Study of ancient runes and Care of Magical Creatures.At the end of their fifth year, students take 
                    the Ordinary Wizarding Level (O.W.L.) examinations for all subjects in which they are enrolled. Each examination 
                    consists of a written knowledge test and, where applicable, a practical demonstration of skills before a panel of
                    proctors from the Ministry of Magic. Students who achieve a high enough O.W.L. grade in a particular subject may 
                    take its advanced course for the final two years, in preparation for the Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests (N.E.W.T.) 
                    given at the end of the seventh year.
